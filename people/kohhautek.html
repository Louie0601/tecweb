          Dr. Koh is Deputy Chief Medical Officer, co-overseeing clinical
          services in Jiahui Health, the largest private international
          healthcare ecosystem in Shanghai. He is actively involved in clinical

          Prior to joining Jiahui Health, Dr. Koh was managing another medical
          group in China, responsible for all operations of the group’s

          and has been a practicing physician for over 20 years. Dr. Koh has sat
          on and presided over Medical Boards and Clinical Governance committees
          in several medical groups, including public-listed Parkway Health

          involved in multiple large-scale projects in both B2B and B2G arenas,
          to enhance scope of clinical services and developing new business
          lines. After Parkway Health, Dr. Koh was Vice-President, International

          Republic of Ireland. After achieving membership to the Royal College
          of Surgeons in Ireland, he returned to Singapore and further obtained
          a Master in Medicine (Surgery), Singapore. Dr. Koh then went into
          Family Medicine and subsequent Occupational Medicine training programs
          which he completed and became both a registered Family Physician with
          the Singapore Medical Council and a registered Designated Workplace
          Doctor with Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower. He is currently in
          healthcare management and clinical practice. Over the last 15 years,
          Dr. Koh also completed an Advanced Management Program (Nanyang-UC
          Berkeley), and holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from
          Nanyang Business School in Nanyang Technological University Singapore.

          <br /><br />
          Dr. Koh has been working closely with TEC as a partner in having
          COVID-19 vaccinations for expats and TEC members. In this time of
          COVID in China, Jiahui International Hospital continues to provide a
          critical support pillar by having COVID-19 vaccinations in a credible
          world-class facility with strong operational capabilities, and a good
          track record and well-trained medical/nursing staff. <br /><br />
          In addition, Jiahui International Hospital and Jiahui Clinics have
          been open throughout the Shanghai lockdown recently, continuing to
          provide much needed healthcare services in the clinics, outpatients,
          emergency department, inpatients, and surgeries in multiple medical
          departments.
          <br /><br />
          Dr. Koh continues to support TEC through provision of cost-effective
          world-class healthcare and its related clinical capabilities.
