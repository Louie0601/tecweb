          Keith obtained MBA degree at Warwick University and received his CPA
          in Australia.
          <br /><br />
          Keith has worked with HSBC China for the last 10 years within the
          Wealth & Personal Banking department, specifically overseeing the
          Cards & Loans Proposition Team. Experience has also covered managing a
          nationwide sales team & co-branding partnerships.
          <br /><br />

          as a key member of their Global cards Team.
          <br /><br />
          Keith started his career with Barclaycard UK on their graduate
          programme and over 10 years worked on retail card portfolios across
          UK, Europe, Africa and South East Asia.

          “I served in a few TEC events, and the most recent being one of the
          emcee’s at the Christmas gala dinner. It was great to be part of an
          event raising funds for charities which will benefit children in
          Shanghai and Yunan, and also the senior citizens in Shanghai. Being
          able to see the participants enjoy the good food whilst taking in the
          fantastic Christmas performances, and for them to give so generously
          to the various charities made it a memorable night. I was extremely
          happy and privileged to be a part of this great team.”

          “Also helping at the 3E event as one of the emcees was very
          interesting as I had the best opportunity to listen to the interesting
          speakers from the government and across all different industries share
          their views on a variety of topics impacting today’s commercial world.
          It was encouraging to see so many people benefitting from all the
          companies who had set up recruitment booths, and also the
          entrepreneurs who received mentorship and also a financial boost to
          their projects.”
